1. Overview of the Project

        This project focuses on building an AI-based garbage 
        classification system using image processing and deep    
        learning. The goal is to automatically classify waste into 
        categories such as plastic, glass, paper, cardboard,  organic,
        and metal, thereby supporting recycling and sustainable waste
        management.

2. Dataset Details

    Source: Garbage classification dataset from Kaggle.

    Categories: Battery, Biological, Cardboard, Clothes, Glass, Metal, Organic, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, Trash.

    Size: ~13000 images across all categories.

4. How to Run the Code

    1.0 open the caggle notebook and upload the raw data set

    1.1 set the path

    1.2 Run each member's Notebook

    1.3 Finally, open and run group_pipeline.ipynb

5. output 

     The output is a fully preprocessed dataset with:

        Normalized data
        noise removed
        lebel encoded
        augmented 
        resized
